    funding_html: We are providing schools with almost £1.1 billion in 2024-25 through the new Core Schools Budget Grant (CSBG), to support them with overall costs, including the costs of this year’s teachers’ pay award. We are also providing an additional £97 million in respect of schools delivering post-16 and early years provision, so together we’re providing almost £1.2 billion additional funding in 2024-25.
